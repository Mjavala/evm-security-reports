# Bug Notes

*In the current rewards accounting, vault shares in deposit() and redeem() can not correctly record the spot yields generated by the staked asset. Yields are released over the next rewards cycle. As a result, malicious users can steal yields from innocent users by picking special timing to deposit() and redeem().*
